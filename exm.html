        <div class="card-description">
            Winglets built into the upper cowl generate downforce that helps keep the front wheel on the ground during strong acceleration.

        <h2 class="card-title">Powerful 998 cm3 Liquid-Cooled, 4-Stroke In-Line Four Engine</h2>
        <div class="card-description">
            The Ninja ZX-10R’s engine balances stunning power with manageability. Positioning peak torque high up in the rpm range makes it easier for riders to get back on the gas, while a strong low-mid range further contributes to acceleration coming out of corners. Finger-follower valve actuation and other features based on feedback from Kawasaki’s WSB factory team contribute to a peak power of 203 PS†, which can easily be augmented care of a full race exhaust. Updates for 2021 offer increased cooling performance and emissions that meet Euro5 requirements while maintaining the engine’s performance and easy-to-use character.

        <div class="card-description">
            Based on feedback from Kawasaki’s WSB race machine, the new air-cooled oil cooler is a design often seen on high-performance models. Rather than routing coolant from the radiator to the oil cooler and back to the engine, the new oil cooler is air-cooled and has an independent circuit. Oil is routed from the left lower crankcase to the oil cooler, where it is cooled, then returned on the right side. The increased cooling performance contributes to engine performance at all rpm.

        <h2 class="card-title">Close-ratio Transmission</h2>
        <div class="card-description">
            Use of a “reverse slant” design sees the new LED headlights positioned on the underside of the upper cowl. Because the headlights are not visible from the rider’s point of view, the uninterrupted surface conjures the image of piloting a race machine. The LED headlights use direct projection units. The LED headlights are bright, compact, and lightweight.

            Slots incorporated in the new tail cowl design contribute to the aerodynamic styling. LED taillight design gives the rear a sharp impression. LED-type rear turn signals complete the all-LED lighting package.

            In recognition of its achievement in the Superbike World Championship, special permission to use the River Mark on the Ninja ZX-10R was granted. This is its first use on a non-supercharged mass-production model.

            The compact new 4.3” all-digital TFT colour instrumentation gives the cockpit a high-tech, high-grade appearance. The new meter also offers additional features unavailable on the previous model.
